# Help Your Club – Pay Your Fees

It takes a lot to run a club. Membership fees assist our Committee in paying for essentials such as:

- Physio
- Player Insurance
- Coaching
- Equipment
- Reduced kit and travel
- … and more

---

We have the **lowest membership fees across Ulster**, and if everyone plays their part we can keep it that way.  

**Returning player:** £90  
**Fresher:** £80  

If you pay before 30th September you will receive:

- QUBRFC playing socks  
- Access to discounted club tie  
- Access to discounted club formal tickets  
- Continued access to physio  
- Access to Six Nations tickets when applicable  

(*Extended deadline to 30th October for Freshers*)
